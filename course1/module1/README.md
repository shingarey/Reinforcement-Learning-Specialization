[Assignment 1](programming_assignments/Assignment1.ipynb):

Help you create your first bandit algorithm
Help you understand the effect of epsilon on exploration and learn about the exploration/exploitation tradeoff
Introduce you to some of the reinforcement learning software we are going to use for this specialization

This class uses RL-Glue to implement most of our experiments. It was originally designed by Adam White, Brian Tanner, and Rich Sutton. This library will give you a solid framework to understand how reinforcement learning experiments work and how to run your own. If it feels a little confusing at first, don't worry - we are going to walk you through it slowly and introduce you to more and more parts as you progress through the specialization.

We are assuming that you have used a Jupyter notebook before. But if not, it is quite simple. Simply press the run button, or shift+enter to run each of the cells. The places in the code that you need to fill in will be clearly marked for you.
